# P√âTANQUE-WEB: Tournaments Management üèüÔ∏è

Hi! This project is a complete web application for managing p√©tanque tournaments. I've tried to automate and simplify the organization of every event, from the team draw to prize money management. I hope it helps you!

## What does it do?

* **Poule Creation**: Automatically generates poules for three or four-player team tournaments.
* **Draws**: Manages "baraondes" and group draws in a fair and random way.
* **Prize Management**: Calculates and manages the division of prize money based on results.
* **Complete Competitions**: Provides all the necessary tools to follow a competition from start to finish.

## Technical Requirements
